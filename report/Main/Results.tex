\section{Summary of the results} \label{T3}

\paragraph{}To conclude, the analysis of these results shows that we can get way better performance using MySQL Cluster than MySQL Standalone when it comes to workload with a majority of read operations. It could be interesting to test a workload with a majority of write operations because it is the type of operation that a MySQL Standalone could perform way better with since it doesn't have to replicate the data to the Slave nodes.
